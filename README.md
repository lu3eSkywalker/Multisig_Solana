# Multisig_Solana


This is a basic multisig (multi-signature) program built on Solana using the Anchor framework. It allows multiple owners to collectively approve and execute arbitrary on-chain transactions, providing shared control over account actions.
ðŸ“¦ Features

    Create a multisig wallet with multiple owners and a required approval threshold.

    Propose a transaction (with custom instruction data) by one of the owners.

    Approve transactions by the rest of the owners.

    Execute transactions once the required number of approvals is met.
